                <h3> History... </h3>
                <p> Pokemon is around 26 years old at this point and is still among the most popular <br>
                    and well known brands around the world.  The idea was originally created by two men <br>
                    Sashoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori.  Before Pokemon these two men created magazines and video games <br>
                    with the company Game Freak.  After a few years he came up with the idea Pocket Monsters <br>
                    now known as Pokemon. Pokemon was first released in february 1996 with its original name Pocket Monsters.
                    It was extremely successful selling tons of copies within only Japan. <br>
                    It was later released in the US and Uk a few years later. Now its selling games, shows, movies and Pokemon cards in extreme numbers. We all remember collecting, playing or watching as a kid, and now you understand some of the backstory for Pocket Monsters the original Pokemon.
